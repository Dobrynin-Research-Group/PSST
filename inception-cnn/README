This folder is scratch code for training/testing an inception-based CNN on predicting Bg and Bth,
and then using those values to fit an equation to predict Pe. Loss function of Bg and Bth is backpropogated
to train the network.

Folder optim (inside res_96_fit) attempts to implement Bayesian optimization in an attempt to tune the
hyperparameters lr (learning rate), batch_size, weight_decay, resolution of input surfaces, beta_1 and beta_2, and epsilon.
